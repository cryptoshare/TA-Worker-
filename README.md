# TA Worker (FastAPI) â€” Multiâ€‘TF OHLCV + Advanced Indicators for Futures Trading

Deploy this service on Railway. It exposes an HTTP endpoint that fetches futures candles
from Bybit, computes advanced technical indicators across multiple timeframes, and returns a comprehensive
snapshot JSON your Make.com scenario can pass to ChatGPT's Decision Engine.

## ðŸš€ Advanced Features
- **Order Blocks Detection** - Identify liquidity zones and breakout points
- **Support & Resistance Levels** - Dynamic pivot point analysis
- **Fibonacci Retracements** - Standard and extension levels
- **Elliott Wave Analysis** - Pattern recognition and wave counting
- **Multi-timeframe Analysis** - 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d timeframes
- **Futures-focused** - Optimized for perpetual futures trading

## Endpoints

- `GET /v1/healthz` â€” simple health check
- `GET /v1/run` â€” builds and returns the snapshot
  - Query params (optional): `symbol`, `tfs` (comma list), `lookback`, `category`

Example:
```
GET /v1/run?symbol=HYPEUSDT&tfs=15m,1h,4h,1d&lookback=300&category=linear
```

## Deploy on Railway

1. Create a new service from this repository.
2. Start command:
```
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```
3. Variables (Settings â†’ Variables):
   - `SYMBOL` (default pair)
   - `TF_LIST` (e.g., `15m,1h,4h,1d`)
   - `LOOKBACK` (e.g., `300`)
   - `BYBIT_CATEGORY` (`linear` for futures, `spot` for spot trading)
   - Optional: `WRITE_SNAPSHOT_JSON=true`
   - Optional: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (if you want to upsert data)

## Make.com usage

- Add **HTTP â†’ Make a request** to `GET https://<yourâ€‘railwayâ€‘url>/v1/run?...`
- Use the returned JSON `features` as input to your ChatGPT Decision Engine.
- If you later add Supabase, the service can upsert `ohlcv` and `ta_features` automatically.

## Notes
- Only closed candles are used; the last forming bar is ignored for features.
- **Futures-focused**: Defaults to linear perpetual futures for better leverage and liquidity.
